THE CODE WORKS IN TWO WAYS

FOR data encryption i have applied a similar technique as used in DES, data is first generated in its binary form and than encryption is done by keys, each key is unique as it is taken from the binary form itself

also all the data and passwords are encrypted so you to verify yourself as an owner to get your details

you can only delete a node if it is present and you are the owner of that node
